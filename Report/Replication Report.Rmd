# **Replication Report**

**Word Counter: X** 

## **Introduction**
The overall transparency of the paper was mediocre. They provided an extensive readme file with a proper explanation of the script about all tables and figures. Moreover, we appreciated their comments within the scripts allowing an exact understanding of the methods and procedures used to visualize the data.  
However, we were not able to reproduce all tabes and figures due to missing scripts and/or datasets. This was the case for table 1, table 2, figure 1 and figure 5. The ReadMe.txt file contained URLs to downaload the datasets for figure 1 and figure 5. Nevertheless, the [URL of figure 1](https://www.asanet.org/research/stats/social_science_degrees_by_gender_since_1966.cfm) was invalid, probably due to a major update of the website. Providing URLs is definitely not a good choice to ensure the long-term replicapiblity of a scientific paper as they get invalid from time to time due to website updates. The [URL of figure 5](https://www.bls.gov/oes/tables.htm) was still valid but the presented dataset did not clearly indicate the categorization of the variables (e.g. Did the authors include the category "architects" to the category of "engineers"?). We also reached out to the authors to get the missing scripts and datasets, without any success.  
Apart from that, the authors comments were somtimes misleading so that we could not to assign specific sections of the script to the corresponding tables or figures. E.g. There was an appendix after figure 3 that was already part of figure 4. This led to intial confusion as this additional junks of code substantially changed the looks and results of figure 3.


## **Description of the data**
Our replication paper only contains descriptive statistics. For this reason, we mainly focus on the applied method and the operationalization of the variables.  

- Criticize aggressive claims
1) Insularity: Sufficient evidence with no interidisciplinary benefit and citing others
2) Hierarchy: Not a good measure to proove superiority of economists
3) Other differentiators: Good indicator for their main thesis -> evidence for selfishness, more income, and higher, self-confidence 
4) Reorientation to business and finance not a good indicator for their main thesis
- Methods: Only descriptives -> normative claims 

Bad Balance between descriptive and normative claims. What is the overall purpose of the paper? Do they simply describe the shifting relationships and the general relationship of the 2 disciplines and how does that fit together with their normative claim that economists see themselves as a superior class. 
```{r echo = TRUE}
here::here("Data")
list.files()
orgs <- rm(list=ls())
orgs <- rio::import("Data/Org-Affiliations.csv")

props.org <- as.data.frame(prop.table(table(orgs$RANK, orgs$ORGANIZATION),2)*100)
colnames(props.org) <- c("Rank", "Organization", "Freq")
props.org$Rank<-factor(props.org$Rank, levels = c("Top 5","Top 6-10","Top 11-20","Top 21-50","Top 51-100","Not ranked"))

p<-ggplot(props.org, aes(x=Rank, y=Freq, fill=Organization))+scale_fill_grey()
p+geom_bar(position="dodge", stat="identity")+ xlab("\n\nRanking\n")+ ylab("Members of the Councils (%)\n\n")+theme_bw() + theme(axis.text.x  = element_text(size=13), legend.text = element_text(size = 12), legend.title = element_text(size=12))

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
